Hello, I'm Jason Taylor. Welcome to my comprehensive course

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,566
on the Git source control system. Since this course is designed to

4
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:19,866
walk you through the basic concepts to mastery to Git,

5
00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:23,000
I have several goals for this course.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,800
First, I want to make sure you know where to go for help

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,800
on Git concepts and commands. You should understand

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,466
the core concepts in Git, including general source control principles.

9
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:39,266
You should have a very good understanding and practice

10
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:44,933
with the main commands, including common options and parameters.

11
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:49,500
You will be able to compare differences with ease;

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,866
branching and merging will become second nature as we thoroughly cover

13
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:58,366
both topics. You will become familiar with GitHub,

14
00:00:58,366 --> 00:01:04,300
one of the most popular Git repository hosting services available.

15
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:11,700
In doing so, I want you to learn Git well enough that you could teach a friend or teammate.

16
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,100
Finally, I want you to enjoy the bonus material at the end.

17
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,733
Bonus content is provided to supplement the course

18
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:30,100
with alternative approaches, tips and tricks, and non-critical skills.
