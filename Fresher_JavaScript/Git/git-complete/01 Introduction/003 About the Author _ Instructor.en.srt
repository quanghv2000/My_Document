2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,800
So, you might be curious who I am and why I am qualified to teach this course.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,100
Well, I'm a senior software engineer, with over 15 years of experience.

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:24,233
I've worked in all sizes of companies, from startups to large enterprises,

5
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:27,900
and I even do freelancing from time to time.

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,400
In my various roles, I've gravitated towards

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,366
the unofficial DevOps responsibilities,

8
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:38,933
in order to solve problems that commonly vex developers.

9
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:43,866
I have used some type of version control system for most of my career;

10
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:47,833
from CVS to Git, and several in-between.

11
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:52,233
In particular, I have trained hundreds of developers in person,

12
00:00:52,233 --> 00:01:01,866
as well as thousands online, on how to use Git for source control.
