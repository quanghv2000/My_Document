2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,233
In order to accomplish the course goals,

3
00:00:09,233 --> 00:00:13,000
the approach I'm going to take will follow this format:

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,300
first, an introduction to this course,

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:21,300
including the main motivation for source control and Git;

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,633
then, I will walk through, step by step, the installation of Git

7
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:31,366
on Windows, and the Mac; and the initial setup.

8
00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:35,766
Once Git is installed, we will dive directly into a hands-on

9
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:41,400
quick win on command line, before going over any heavy theory.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,900
I think theory and key concepts will be better understood

11
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:50,466
after some practical experience. After we have a better understanding

12
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:54,466
of how Git works, we'll dive back into the command line

13
00:00:54,466 --> 00:00:57,966
by covering the basic commands in more detail.

14
00:00:57,966 --> 00:01:01,400
Some of it will be review from the quickstart earlier,

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,533
but I will be adding much more detail, and more commands in this section.

16
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:10,766
With lots of changes in our repository, we will cover how to compare

17
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:15,200
the differences within our repository. After all of that,

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,966
we will cover a major part of Git: branching and merging.

19
00:01:18,966 --> 00:01:21,666
Branching and merging are encouraged so much more

20
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:27,900
than in other version control systems, that I'm going to cover this in great detail.

21
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,266
Along the way, you will be exposed to GitHub,

22
00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:35,333
which is the most popular Git hosting provider available.

23
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:40,133
And also, when needed, we will install and configure any tools

24
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:47,233
that are required, including a text editor and a visual compare and mergetool.

25
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:50,900
As promised, I will have tons of bonus content,

26
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,433
that I will keep adding on a regular basis, to keep this course fresh.

27
00:01:55,433 --> 00:01:58,766
I believe the core of this course is done,

28
00:01:58,766 --> 00:02:04,433
but I'm still working on many additional sections and refinements to this course.

29
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:10,233
So, I have priced this course accordingly. As a student of this course,

30
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:19,900
you will receive all updates free with your lifetime access.
