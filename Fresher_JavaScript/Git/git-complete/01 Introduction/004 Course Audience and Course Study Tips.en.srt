2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:11,100
This course does have a few important assumptions and a target audience.

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,900
First of all, I assume that you have some basic computer skills.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,166
I realize that is a vague requirement, and I suspect if you are able to join this course

5
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:27,133
and start watching it, then you are probably computer-literate enough for this course.

6
00:00:27,133 --> 00:00:30,233
The next requirement is a bit more tricky;

7
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:33,933
you need to be able to install software on your computer,

8
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:37,900
and that normally requires admin rights.

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,966
This is generally not an issue, unless you are on a work computer;

10
00:00:41,966 --> 00:00:46,900
that is, your IT department controls the rights to your system.

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,266
If you are on a personal computer, then you should have admin rights.

12
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:56,200
If you are unsure, just ask a more computer-savvy friend for help.

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,366
My next assumption is based on my target audience;

14
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:06,866
I assume you need source control, whether or not you realize that fact.

15
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:10,800
The people that need source control, would be anyone that creates original,

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,500
creative assets, like programming source code,

17
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,466
or web design content; which would include freelancers,

18
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:24,400
software developers, programmers, as well as web and graphic designers.

19
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,200
Finally, I assume that you have some interest in learning about Git.

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,200
This could extend beyond the need for source control directly;

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,466
for example, you could be an IT manager trying to understand

22
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:42,300
why your technical staff wants to use Git for their next project.

23
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:48,800
To get the most out of this course, I recommend following along as much as possible;

24
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,433
use another monitor, or device, as a second screen,

25
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:55,866
while you follow along with the course instructions.

26
00:01:55,866 --> 00:02:01,033
And I may go a bit fast at times, so please pause the video

27
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:06,966
between commands or actions, to ensure you follow each step exactly.

28
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:11,333
This course provides lots of supplemental materials including:

29
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:15,100
a listing of every command I type during this course,

30
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:21,733
diagrams and illustrations for many concepts, and source code examples.

31
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:26,866
This course will evolve over time; I may add additional sections,

32
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:30,233
or more bonus content, to keep the course fresh

33
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:35,466
and to add more value to my students, so check back often.

34
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:47,533
Finally, connect with me on my website, twitter, Facebook, or my YouTube channel.
