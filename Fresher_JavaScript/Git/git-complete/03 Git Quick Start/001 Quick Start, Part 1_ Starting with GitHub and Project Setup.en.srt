1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000


2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,666
In order to show the entire Git workflow, including the remote and local sides,

3
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:17,433
I will be starting with GitHub, by creating a repository there,

4
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:22,166
and then making a copy of that repository on our local system,

5
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:27,633
and, finally, synchronizing our changes back up to GitHub.

6
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:33,466
Allong the way, I'm going to explain each and every command used and why.

7
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:38,533
I'm going to start of by going to GitHub. While there are several Git hosting

8
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:43,466
services out there, GitHub is by far the most popular.

9
00:00:43,466 --> 00:00:49,433
So, open your favorite modern browser, and then navigate to "github.com".

10
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:54,500
Once the page loads, you can sign in or sign up.

11
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,966
If you already have an account with GitHub, then click the "Sign In" button

12
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:04,333
near the top of the page, which loads the "Sign in" page.

13
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:09,533
Use your GitHub username and password to log in to your GitHub account.

14
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:14,533
However, if you are new to GitHub, you will need to sign up for an account.

15
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:29,866
From the GitHub homepage, fill out the sign up form to start the process.

16
00:01:29,866 --> 00:01:36,033
You might be prompted for another screen if your initial username is already taken.

17
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:51,766
If so, just fill in that page until you are able to pick a username that isn't already taken.

18
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:55,666
Once you make it to the "Welcome to GitHub" page,

19
00:01:55,666 --> 00:02:00,733
you officially have an account. Currently, GitHub uses the welcome page

20
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:04,133
to encourage you to sign up for a paid level.

21
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:09,966
However, the default is a free account, and that's all we need for this course.

22
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:14,800
At this point, just click on your username near the top of the page,

23
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,966
this will load your GitHub profile page.

24
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:25,166
Now, click on the odd-looking icon near the top left hand side of the page.

25
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:31,033
This is the Octocat logo that GitHub uses. Once you click on that logo,

26
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:36,400
That will bring you to the newsfeed page; it is the page you would normally land on

27
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,133
when you just sign into GitHub, which should have everyone on the same page now.

28
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:46,233
Let's create a new Git repository by clicking on the green

29
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:51,566
"New repository" button near the right hand side of the page.

30
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:56,866
Once the "New Repository" page loads, you'll notice a form asking

31
00:02:56,866 --> 00:03:00,733
for a few pieces of information. For new accounts,

32
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:04,566
there should only be one owner available in the dropdown,

33
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:09,833
and it should be defaulted to your username. "Repository name" is a name

34
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:16,233
you wish to give your Git repository. I recommend a short, but descriptive name,

35
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:21,866
in all lowercase, no spaces, and words separated by dashes.

36
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:28,133
I'm going to use "github-demo" for the repository name.

37
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:33,566
The description is optional, but certainly a good idea. I'm going to type:

38
00:03:33,566 --> 00:03:39,633
"A simple demo repository to show the basic Git workflow".

39
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:45,166
I'm going to leave the repository as public, and then click the

40
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:51,466
"Initialize this repository with a README"; that will start off our repository

41
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:56,433
with a simple README file. I'm going to leave the other options alone.

42
00:03:56,433 --> 00:04:00,666
Double-check the form; make any adjustments if necessary,

43
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:06,600
and then click the "Create repository" button. Once that is done,

44
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:15,800
the repository will be created, and you will land on the main repository page.

45
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,666
Now that we've created our first repository on GitHub,

46
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:23,733
we need to prepare our local system before we can proceed.

47
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:28,266
I'm going to be doing most of my work in the command line. On windows,

48
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:33,533
use Git Bash, on the Mac, use the default terminal application

49
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:40,166
or, a third party terminal program like iTerm 2, which is what I'm using.

50
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:44,266
Either way, the Git commands will be the same. So now

51
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:48,966
open your terminal program. By default, your terminal program should

52
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:56,500
put you in your user's home directory, which we can confirm by typing "pwd".

53
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,800
I like to manage all my projects together in a projects directory

54
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:09,400
within my user's directory. To create that directory type "mkdir projects",

55
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:17,133
then press enter. Then change into that directory: "cd projects", press enter.

56
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:21,900
Now if we "pwd", you can see that we are now within our

57
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:30,366
"projects" folder underneath the user's home directory.
